	abstract = {This paper investigates the use of sparse overcomplete decompositions for audio coding. Audio signals are decomposed over a redundant union of modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) bases having eight different scales. This approach produces a sparser decomposition than the traditional MDCT-based orthogonal transform and allows better coding efficiency at low bitrates. Contrary to state-of-the-art low bitrate coders, which are based on pure parametric or hybrid representations, our approach is able to provide transparency. Moreover, we use a bitplane encoding approach, which provides a fine-grain scalable coder that can seamlessly operate from very low bitrates up to transparency. Objective evaluation, as well as listening tests, show that the performance of our coder is significantly better than a state-of-the-art transform coder at very low bitrates and has similar performance at high bitrates. We provide a link to test soundfiles and source code to allow better evaluation and reproducibility of the results.},

Here, we show that the representations used in standard transform-based audio codecs (e.g., MDCT for AAC, or hybrid PQF/MDCT for MP3) have a sufficient time resolution for some rhythmic features, but a poor frequency resolution, which prevents their use in tonality-related applications. Alternatively, a recently developed audio codec based on a sparse multi-scale MDCT transform has a good resolution both for time- and frequency-domain features. We show that this new audio codec allows efficient transform-domain audio indexing for three different applications, namely beat tracking, chord recognition, and musical genre classification. We compare results obtained with this new audio codec and the two standard MP3 and AAC codecs, in terms of performance and computation time.},

	abstract = {A perceptual audio coder typically consists of a filter-bank which breaks the signal into its frequency components. These components are then quantized using a perceptual masking model. Previous efforts have indicated that a high resolution filter-bank, e.g., the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) with 1024 subbands, is able to minimize the bit rate requirements for most of the music samples. The high resolution MDCT, however, is not suitable for the encoding of non-stationary segments of music. A long/short resolution or "window" switching scheme has been employed to overcome this problem but it has certain inherent disadvantages which become prominent at lower bit rates ({\textless}64 kbps for stereo). We propose a novel switched filter-bank scheme which switches between a MDCT and a wavelet filter-bank based on the signal characteristics. A tree structured wavelet filter-bank with properly designed filters offers natural advantages for the representation of non-stationary segments such as attacks. Furthermore, it allows for the optimum exploitation of perceptual irrelevancies.},
